I am a second-year PhD student at <a href='https://ai4ce.github.io'>NYU AI4CE Lab</a> led by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YeG8ZM0AAAAJ&hl=en'>Chen Feng</a>. Before my Ph.D journey, I worked as a research assistant at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2023 and I received B.E. degree at Tongji Univerisity (TJU) advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zmbMZ4kAAAAJ&hl=en'>Changhong Fu</a> in Jul. 2022.

<!-- I am also an NVIDIA Graduate Fellow at the <a href='https://nvr-avg.github.io/'>Autonmous Vehicle Research Group</a>, working closely with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RhOpyXcAAAAJ&hl=en'>Marco Pavone</a>, <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Oyx-_UIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Jose M. Alvarez</a>, and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CUlqK5EAAAAJ'>Sanja Fidler</a>. Before that, I had the opportunity to work as an intern at NVIDIA AI Research advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bEcLezcAAAAJ&hl=en'>Anima Anandkumar</a> in 2022, and a research assistant at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W_Q33RMAAAAJ&hl=en'>Siheng Chen</a> in 2021.   -->

My research vision is to enable ***collaborative autonomous intelligence*** by empowering robots with human-level **spatial**, **social**, and **self-awareness**, allowing them to actively perceive and plan in unstructured environments, interact effectively with humans or other robots, and leverage as well as augment the associated memory. To this end, I draw from vision, learning, robotics, graphics, language, sensing, data science, and cognitive science. My research works include developing **robust, efficient, and scalable** computational models for *3D scene parsing and decision-making* from high-dimensional sensory input, as well as **curating large-scale datasets** to effectively train and verify these models for self-driving and robotics.
