I am a second-year PhD student at <a href='https://ai4ce.github.io'>NYU AI4CE Lab</a> led by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YeG8ZM0AAAAJ&hl=en'>Chen Feng</a>. Before my Ph.D journey, I worked as a research assistant at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2023 and I received B.E. degree at Tongji Univerisity (TJU) advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zmbMZ4kAAAAJ&hl=en'>Changhong Fu</a> in Jul. 2022.

<!-- I am also an NVIDIA Graduate Fellow at the <a href='https://nvr-avg.github.io/'>Autonmous Vehicle Research Group</a>, working closely with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RhOpyXcAAAAJ&hl=en'>Marco Pavone</a>, <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Oyx-_UIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Jose M. Alvarez</a>, and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CUlqK5EAAAAJ'>Sanja Fidler</a>. Before that, I had the opportunity to work as an intern at NVIDIA AI Research advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bEcLezcAAAAJ&hl=en'>Anima Anandkumar</a> in 2022, and a research assistant at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W_Q33RMAAAAJ&hl=en'>Siheng Chen</a> in 2021.   -->

<!-- :pray: <b><font color="purple">I will graduate in Fall 2024 and am actively seeking a postdoctoral or industrial position, starting in Spring 2025. </font></b> -->

My research lies in the intersection of ***robotics and spatial intelligence***, whose goal is to drastically improve robotic reliability, intelligence and security **in complex scenarios**. These works are motivated by the urgent need of **3D representation learning for robotics with minimal supervision** and **spatial reasoning** with **multiple sensors**, such as inferring a complete model of a scene with **image/language/cloud points information**. More specifically, my research interests include: (1) computer vision and robotics: collaborative perception, 3D scene understanding, video understanding; (2) machine learning: adversarial learning, representation Learning, and multimodal learning; (3) applications: self-driving, robotics, construction automation, and human-robot interaction.
