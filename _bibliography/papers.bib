  abstract={A proper scene representation is central to the pursuit of spatial intelligence where agents can robustly reconstruct and efficiently understand 3D scenes. A scene representation is either metric, such as landmark maps in 3D reconstruction, 3D bounding boxes in object detection, or voxel grids in occupancy prediction, or topological, such as pose graphs with loop closures in SLAM or visibility graphs in SfM. In this work, we propose to build \textit{Multiview Scene Graphs} (MSG) from unposed images, representing a scene topologically with interconnected place and object nodes. The task of building MSG is challenging for existing representation learning methods since it needs to jointly address both visual place recognition, object detection, and object association from images with limited fields of view and potentially large viewpoint changes. To evaluate any method tackling this task, we developed an MSG dataset and annotation based on a public 3D dataset. We also propose an evaluation metric based on the intersection-over-union score of MSG edges. Moreover, we develop a novel baseline method built on mainstream pretrained vision models, combining visual place recognition and object association into one Transformer decoder architecture. Experiments demonstrate our method has superior performance compared to existing relevant baselines.}

  abstract={Nighttime semantic segmentation is essential for various applications, \eg, autonomous driving, which often faces challenges due to poor illumination and the lack of well-annotated datasets. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has shown potential for addressing the challenges and achieved remarkable results for nighttime semantic segmentation. However, existing methods still face limitations in 1) their reliance on style transfer or relighting models, which struggle to generalize to complex nighttime environments, and 2) their ignorance of dynamic and small objects like vehicles and traffic signs, which are difficult to be directly learned from other domains. This paper proposes a novel UDA method that refines both label and feature levels for dynamic and small objects for nighttime semantic segmentation. First, we propose a dynamic and small object refinement module to complement the knowledge of dynamic and small objects that are normally context-inconsistent due to poor illumination. Then, we design a feature prototype alignment module to reduce the domain gap by deploying contrastive learning between features and prototypes of the same class from different domains, while re-weighting the categories of dynamic and small objects. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior arts by a large margin for nighttime segmentation. Our codes will be released soon.}

To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a tracking-oriented adversarial blur-deblur network (ABDNet), composed of a novel deblurrer to recover the visual appearance of the tracked object, and a brand-new blur generator to produce realistic blurry images for adversarial training. More specifically, the deblurrer progressively refines the features through pixel-wise, spatial-wise, and channel-wise stages to achieve excellent deblurring performance. The blur generator adaptively fuses an image sequence with a learnable kernel to create realistic blurry images. During training, ABDNet is plugged into the state-of-the-art real-time trackers and trained with blurring-deblurring loss as well as tracking loss. During inference, the blur generator is removed, while the deblurrer and the tracker can work together for UAV tracking.

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking is crucial for autonomous navigation and has broad applications in robotic automation fields. However, reliable UAV tracking remains a challenging task due to various difficulties like frequent occlusion and aspect ratio change. Additionally, most of the existing work mainly focuses on explicit information to improve tracking performance, ignoring potential interframe connections. To address the above issues, this work proposes a novel framework with continuity-aware latent interframe information mining for reliable UAV tracking, i.e., ClimRT. Specifically, a new efficient continuity-aware latent interframe information mining network (ClimNet) is proposed for UAV tracking, which can generate highly-effective latent frame between two adjacent frames. Besides, a novel location-continuity Transformer (LCT) is designed to fully explore continuity-aware spatial-temporal information, thereby markedly enhancing UAV tracking. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on three authoritative aerial benchmarks strongly validate the robustness and reliability of ClimRT in UAV tracking performance. Furthermore, real-world tests on the aerial platform validate its practicability and effectiveness.}

  abstract={Vision-based object tracking has boosted extensive autonomous applications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the dynamic changes in flight maneuver and viewpoint encountered in UAV tracking pose significant difficulties, e.g. , aspect ratio change, and scale variation. The conventional cross-correlation operation, while commonly used, has limitations in effectively capturing perceptual similarity and incorporates extraneous background information. To mitigate these limitations, this work presents a novel saliency-guided dynamic vision Transformer (SGDViT) for UAV tracking. The proposed method designs a new task-specific object saliency mining network to refine the cross-correlation operation and effectively discriminate foreground and background information. Additionally, a saliency adaptation embedding operation dynamically generates tokens based on initial saliency, thereby reducing the computational complexity of the Transformer architecture. Finally, a lightweight saliency filtering Transformer further refines saliency information and increases the focus on appearance information. The efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach have been thoroughly assessed through experiments on three widely-used UAV tracking benchmarks and real-world scenarios, with results demonstrating its superiority.}

  abstract={Object detection and multiple object tracking (MOT) are essential components of self-driving systems. Accurate detection and uncertainty quantification are both critical for onboard modules, such as perception, prediction, and planning, to improve the safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles. Collaborative object detection (COD) has been proposed to improve detection accuracy and reduce uncertainty by leveraging the viewpoints of multiple agents. However, little attention has been paid on how to leverage the uncertainty quantification from COD to enhance MOT performance. In this paper, as the first attempt, we design the uncertainty propagation framework to address this challenge, called MOT-CUP. Our framework first quantifies the uncertainty of COD through direct modeling and conformal prediction, and propogates this uncertainty information during the motion prediction and association steps. MOT-CUP is designed to work with different collaborative object detectors and baseline MOT algorithms. We evaluate MOT-CUP on V2X-Sim, a comprehensive collaborative perception dataset, and demonstrate a 2% improvement in accuracy and a 2.67X reduction in uncertainty compared to the baselines, e.g., SORT and ByteTrack. MOT-CUP demonstrates the importance of uncertainty quantification in both COD and MOT, and provides the first attempt to improve the accuracy and reduce the uncertainty in MOT based on COD through uncertainty propogation.}

  abstract = {Multiple robots could perceive a scene (e.g., detect objects) collaboratively better than individuals, although easily suffer from adversarial attacks when using deep learning. This could be addressed by the adversarial defense, but its training requires the often-unknown attacking mechanism. Differently, we propose ROBOSAC, a novel sampling-based defense strategy generalizable to unseen attackers. Our key idea is that collaborative perception should lead to consensus rather than dissensus in results compared to individual perception. This leads to our hypothesize-and-verify framework: perception results with and without collaboration from a random subset of teammates are compared until reaching a consensus. In such a framework, more teammates in the sampled subset often entail better perception performance but require longer sampling time to reject potential attackers. Thus, we derive how many sampling trials are needed to ensure the desired size of an attacker-free subset, or equivalently, the maximum size of such a subset that we can successfully sample within a given number of trials. We validate our method on the task of collaborative 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenarios.}

  abstract={Visual object tracking is essential to intelligent robots. Most existing approaches have ignored the online latency that can cause severe performance degradation during real-world processing. Especially for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where robust tracking is more challenging and onboard computation is limited, the latency issue can be fatal. In this work, we present a simple framework for end-to-end latency-aware tracking, i.e., end-to-end predictive visual tracking (PVT++). Unlike existing solutions that naively append Kalman Filters after trackers, PVT++ can be jointly optimized, so that it takes not only motion information but can also leverage the rich visual knowledge in most pre-trained tracker models for robust prediction. Besides, to bridge the training-evaluation domain gap, we propose a relative motion factor, empowering PVT++ to generalize to the challenging and complex UAV tracking scenes. These careful designs have made the small-capacity lightweight PVT++ a widely effective solution. Additionally, this work presents an extended latency-aware evaluation benchmark for assessing an any-speed tracker in the online setting. Empirical results on a robotic platform from the aerial perspective show that PVT++ can achieve significant performance gain on various trackers and exhibit higher accuracy than prior solutions, largely mitigating the degradation brought by latency.}

  abstract = {We propose DeepExplorer, a simple and lightweight metric-free exploration method for topological mapping of unknown environments. It performs task and motion planning (TAMP) entirely in image feature space. The task planner is a recurrent network using the latest image observation sequence to hallucinate a feature as the next-best exploration goal. The motion planner then utilizes the current and the hallucinated features to generate an action taking the agent towards that goal. The two planners are jointly trained via deeply-supervised imitation learning from expert demonstrations. During exploration, we iteratively call the two planners to predict the next action, and the topological map is built by constantly appending the latest image observation and action to the map and using visual place recognition (VPR) for loop closing. The resulting topological map efficiently represents an environment's connectivity and traversability, so it can be used for tasks such as visual navigation. We show DeepExplorer's exploration efficiency and strong sim2sim generalization capability on large-scale simulation datasets like Gibson and MP3D. Its effectiveness is further validated via the image-goal navigation performance on the resulting topological map. We further show its strong zero-shot sim2real generalization capability in real-world experiments. }

  abstract={Humans can easily imagine the complete 3D geometry of occluded objects and scenes. This appealing ability is vital for recognition and understanding. To enable such capability in AI systems, we propose VoxFormer, a Transformerbased semantic scene completion framework that can output complete 3D volumetric semantics from only 2D images. Our framework adopts a two-stage design where we start from a sparse set of visible and occupied voxel queries from depth estimation, followed by a densification stage that generates dense 3D voxels from the sparse ones. A key idea of this design is that the visual features on 2D images correspond only to the visible scene structures rather than the occluded or empty spaces. Therefore, starting with the featurization and prediction of the visible structures is more reliable. Once we obtain the set of sparse queries, we apply a masked autoencoder design to propagate the information to all the voxels by self-attention. Experiments on SemanticKITTI show that VoxFormer outperforms the state of the art with a relative improvement of 20.0% in geometry and 18.1% in semantics and reduces GPU memory during training to less than 16GB.

To tackle such a global point cloud registration problem, DeepMapping [1] converts the complex map estimation into a self-supervised training of simple deep networks. Despite its broad convergence range on small datasets, DeepMapping still cannot produce satisfactory results on large-scale datasets with thousands of frames. This is due to the lack of loop closures and exact cross-frame point correspondences, and the slow convergence of its global localization network. We propose DeepMapping2 by adding two novel techniques to address these issues: (1) organization of training batch based on map topology from loop closing, and (2) self-supervised local-to-global point consistency loss leveraging pairwise registration. Our experiments and ablation studies on public datasets such as KITTI, NCLT, and Nebula demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.}

Hence, uncertainty quantification is crucial for safety-critical systems such as CAVs. Our work is the first to estimate the uncertainty of collaborative object detection. We propose a novel uncertainty quantification method, called Double-M Quantification, which tailors a moving block bootstrap (MBB) algorithm with direct modeling of the multivariant Gaussian distribution of each corner of the bounding box. Our method captures both the epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty with one inference pass based on the offline Double-M training process. And it can be used with different collaborative object detectors. Through experiments on the comprehensive collaborative perception dataset, we show that our Double-M method achieves more than 4× improvement on uncertainty score and more than 3% accuracy improvement, compared with the state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods.}

  abstract={Visual place recognition (VPR) using deep networks has achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, most of the related approaches require a training set with ground truth sensor poses to obtain the positive and negative samples of each observation's spatial neighborhoods. When such knowledge is unknown, the temporal neighborhoods from a sequentially collected data stream could be exploited for self-supervision, although with suboptimal performance. Inspired by noisy label learning, we propose a novel self-supervised VPR framework that uses both the temporal neighborhoods and the learnable feature neighborhoods to discover the unknown spatial neighborhoods. Our method follows an iterative training paradigm which alternates between: (1) representation learning with data augmentation, (2) positive set expansion to include the current feature space neighbors, and (3) positive set contraction via geometric verification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets, with input of both images and point clouds. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines in both recall rate, robustness, and a novel metric we proposed for VPR, the orientation diversity.}

Yet this leads to different information sharing for different tasks, hindering the large-scale deployment of collaborative perception. We propose the first task-agnostic collaborative perception paradigm that learns a single collaboration module in a self-supervised manner for different downstream tasks. This is done by a novel task termed multi-robot scene completion, where each robot learns to effectively share information for reconstructing a complete scene viewed by all robots. Moreover, we propose a spatiotemporal autoencoder (STAR) that amortizes over time the communication cost by spatial sub-sampling and temporal mixing. Extensive experiments validate our method’s effectiveness on scene completion and collaborative perception in autonomous driving scenarios.}

  abstract={We are interested in anticipating as early as possible the target location of a person's object manipulation action in a 3D workspace from egocentric vision. It is important in fields like human-robot collaboration, but has not yet received enough attention from vision and learning communities. To stimulate more research on this challenging egocentric vision task, we propose a large multimodality dataset of more than 1 million frames of RGB-D and IMU streams, and provide evaluation metrics based on our high-quality 2D and 3D labels from semi-automatic annotation. Meanwhile, we design baseline methods using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and conduct various ablation studies to validate their effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that this new task is worthy of further study by researchers in robotics, vision, and learning communities.}

  abstract={Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication techniques enable the collaboration between vehicles and many other entities in the neighboring environment, which could fundamentally improve the perception system for autonomous driving. However, the lack of a public dataset significantly restricts the research progress of collaborative perception. To fill this gap, we present V2X-Sim, a comprehensive simulated multi-agent perception dataset for V2X-aided autonomous driving. V2X-Sim provides: (1) multi-agent sensor recordings from the road-side unit (RSU) and multiple vehicles that enable collaborative perception, (2) multi-modality sensor streams that facilitate multi-modality perception, and (3) diverse ground truths that support various perception tasks. Meanwhile, we build an open-source testbed and provide a benchmark for the state-of-the-art collaborative perception algorithms on three tasks, including detection, tracking and segmentation. V2X-Sim seeks to stimulate collaborative perception research for autonomous driving before realistic datasets become widely available.}

  abstract={To promote better performance-bandwidth trade-off for multi-agent perception, we propose a novel distilled collaboration graph (DiscoGraph) to model trainable, pose-aware, and adaptive collaboration among agents. Our key novelties lie in two aspects. First, we propose a teacher-student framework to train DiscoGraph via knowledge distillation. The teacher model employs an early collaboration with holistic-view inputs; the student model is based on intermediate collaboration with single-view inputs. Our framework trains DiscoGraph by constraining post-collaboration feature maps in the student model to match the correspondences in the teacher model. Second, we propose a matrix-valued edge weight in DiscoGraph. In such a matrix, each element reflects the inter-agent attention at a specific spatial region, allowing an agent to adaptively highlight the informative regions. During inference, we only need to use the student model named as the distilled collaboration network (DiscoNet). Attributed to the teacher-student framework, multiple agents with the shared DiscoNet could collaboratively approach the performance of a hypothetical teacher model with a holistic view. Our approach is validated on V2X-Sim 1.0, a large-scale multi-agent perception dataset that we synthesized using CARLA and SUMO co-simulation. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments in multi-agent 3D object detection show that DiscoNet could not only achieve a better performance-bandwidth trade-off than the state-of-the-art collaborative perception methods, but also bring more straightforward design rationale. }

  abstract={LiDAR point clouds collected from a moving vehicle are functions of its trajectories, because the sensor motion needs to be compensated to avoid distortions. When autonomous vehicles are sending LiDAR point clouds to deep networks for perception and planning, could the motion compensation consequently become a wide-open backdoor in those networks, due to both the adversarial vulnerability of deep learning and GPS-based vehicle trajectory estimation that is susceptible to wireless spoofing? We demonstrate such possibilities for the first time: instead of directly attacking point cloud coordinates which requires tampering with the raw LiDAR readings, only adversarial spoofing of a self-driving car's trajectory with small perturbations is enough to make safety-critical objects undetectable or detected with incorrect positions. Moreover, polynomial trajectory perturbation is developed to achieve a temporally-smooth and highly-imperceptible attack. Extensive experiments on 3D object detection have shown that such attacks not only lower the performance of the state-of-the-art detectors effectively, but also transfer to other detectors, raising a red flag for the community.}

  abstract={Most existing Siamese-based tracking methods execute the classification and regression of the target object based on the similarity maps. However, they either employ a single map from the last convolutional layer which degrades the localization accuracy in complex scenarios or separately use multiple maps for decision making, introducing intractable computations for aerial mobile platforms. Thus, in this work, we propose an efficient and effective hierarchical feature transformer (HiFT) for aerial tracking. Hierarchical similarity maps generated by multi-level convolutional layers are fed into the feature transformer to achieve the interactive fusion of spatial (shallow layers) and semantics cues (deep layers). Consequently, not only the global contextual information can be raised, facilitating the target search, but also our end-to-end architecture with the transformer can efficiently learn the interdependencies among multi-level features, thereby discovering a tracking-tailored feature space with strong discriminability. Comprehensive evaluations on four aerial benchmarks have proven the effectiveness of HiFT. Real-world tests on the aerial platform have strongly validated its practicability with a real-time speed.}

  abstract={Recently, the Siamese-based method has stood out from multitudinous tracking methods owing to its state-of-theart (SOTA) performance. Nevertheless, due to various special challenges in UAV tracking, e.g., severe occlusion and fast motion, most existing Siamese-based trackers hardly combine superior performance with high efficiency. To this concern, in this paper, a novel attentional Siamese tracker (SiamAPN++) is proposed for real-time UAV tracking. By virtue of the attention mechanism, we conduct a special attentional aggregation network (AAN) consisting of self-AAN and cross-AAN for raising the representation ability of features eventually. The former AAN aggregates and models the self-semantic interdependencies of the single feature map via spatial and channel dimensions. The latter aims to aggregate the crossinterdependencies of two different semantic features including the location information of anchors. In addition, the anchor proposal network based on dual features is proposed to raise its robustness of tracking objects with various scales. Experiments on two well-known authoritative benchmarks are conducted, where SiamAPN++ outperforms its baseline SiamAPN and other SOTA trackers. Besides, real-world tests onboard a typical embedded platform demonstrate that SiamAPN++ achieves promising tracking results with real-time speed.}

  abstract={In the domain of visual tracking, most deep learning-based trackers highlight the accuracy but casting aside efficiency. Therefore, their real-world deployment on mobile platforms like the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is impeded. In this work, a novel two-stage Siamese network-based method is proposed for aerial tracking, \textit{i.e.}, stage-1 for high-quality anchor proposal generation, stage-2 for refining the anchor proposal. Different from anchor-based methods with numerous pre-defined fixed-sized anchors, our no-prior method can 1) increase the robustness and generalization to different objects with various sizes, especially to small, occluded, and fast-moving objects, under complex scenarios in light of the adaptive anchor generation, 2) make calculation feasible due to the substantial decrease of anchor numbers. In addition, compared to anchor-free methods, our framework has better performance owing to refinement at stage-2. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks have proven the superior performance of our approach, with a speed of around 200 frames/s.}

  abstract={Most existing trackers based on discriminative correlation filters (DCF) try to introduce predefined regularization term to improve the learning of target objects, e.g., by suppressing background learning or by restricting change rate of correlation filters. However, predefined parameters introduce much effort in tuning them and they still fail to adapt to new situations that the designer didn’t think of. In this work, a novel approach is proposed to online automatically and adaptively learn spatio-temporal regularization term. Spatially local response map variation is introduced as spatial regularization to make DCF focus on the learning of trust-worthy parts of the object, and global response map variation determines the updating rate of the filter. Extensive experiments on four UAV benchmarks, i.e., DTB70, UAVDT, UAV123@10fps and VisDrone-test-dev, have proven that our tracker performs favorably against the state-of-theart CPU- and GPU-based trackers, with average speed of 59.2 frames per second (FPS) running on a single CPU. Our tracker is additionally proposed to be applied to localize the moving camera. Considerable tests in the indoor practical scenarios have proven the effectiveness and versatility of our localization method.}

Previous appearances are also gradually forgotten due to the exponential decay of historical views in traditional appearance updating scheme of DCF framework, reducing the model’s robustness. In this work, a novel tracker based on DCF framework is proposed to augment memory of previously appeared views while running at real-time speed. Several historical views and the current view are simultaneously introduced in training to allow the tracker to adapt to new appearances as well as memorize previous ones. A novel rapid compressed context learning is proposed to increase the discriminative ability of the filter efficiently. Substantial experiments on UAVDT and UAV123 datasets have validated that the proposed tracker performs competitively against other 26 top DCF and deep-based trackers with over 40fps on CPU.}

In this work, a real-time UAV tracking algorithm with powerful size estimation ability is proposed. Specifically, the overall tracking task is allocated to two 2D filters: (i) translation filter for location prediction in the space domain, (ii) size filter for scale and aspect ratio optimization in the size domain. Besides, an efficient two-stage re-detection strategy is introduced for long-term UAV tracking tasks. Large-scale experiments on four UAV benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the presented method which has computation feasibility on a low-cost CPU.}

  abstract={Correlation filter-based tracking has been widely applied in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with high efficiency. However, it has two imperfections, i.e., boundary effect and filter corruption. Several methods enlarging the search area can mitigate boundary effect, yet introducing undesired background distraction. Existing frame-by-frame context learning strategies for repressing background distraction nevertheless lower the tracking speed. Inspired by keyframe-based simultaneous localization and mapping, keyfilter is proposed in visual tracking for the first time, in order to handle the above issues efficiently and effectively. Keyfilters generated by periodically selected keyframes learn the context intermittently and are used to restrain the learning of filters, so that 1) context awareness can be transmitted to all the filters via keyfilter restriction, and 2) filter corruption can be repressed. Compared to the state-ofthe-art results, our tracker performs better on two challenging benchmarks, with enough speed for UAV real-time applications.},

  abstract={Traditional framework of discriminative correlation filters (DCF) is often subject to undesired boundary effects. Several approaches to enlarge search regions have been already proposed in the past years to make up for this shortcoming. However, with excessive background information, more background noises are also introduced and the discriminative filter is prone to learn from the ambiance rather than the object. This situation, along with appearance changes of objects caused by full/partial occlusion, illumination variation, and other reasons has made it more likely to have aberrances in the detection process, which could substantially degrade the credibility of its result. Therefore, in this work, a novel approach to repress the aberrances happening during the detection process is proposed, i.e., aberrance repressed correlation filter (ARCF). By enforcing restriction to the rate of alteration in response maps generated in the detection phase, the ARCF tracker can evidently suppress aberrances and is thus more robust and accurate to track objects. Considerable experiments are conducted on different UAV datasets to perform object tracking from an aerial view, i.e., UAV123, UAVDT, and DTB70, with 243 challenging image sequences containing over 90K frames to verify the performance of the ARCF tracker and it has proven itself to have outperformed other 20 state-of-the-art trackers based on DCF and deep-based frameworks with sufficient speed for real-time applications.}
